# Glossary

**Bootstrap** - the process of provisioning a Kubernetes cluster, by ensuring that each node has the necessary components to be fully operational

**CRD** - Custom Resource Definition provides the ability to extend Kubernetes API and create new resources

**Cluster** - a collection of distributed nodes that are used to manage and host workloads

**Configmap** - a resource to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs.

**Declarative configuration** - resource management technique, that operates and manages resources using YAML manifests stored locally.

**Deployment** - describe the desired state of the application to be deployed

**Dockerfile** - set of instructions used to create a Docker image

**Docker image** - a read-only template used to spin up a runnable instance of an application

**Docker registry** - a central mechanism to store and distribute Docker images

**Imperative configuration** - resource management technique, that operates and interacts directly with the live objects within the cluster.

**Ingress** - a mechanism to manage the access from external users and workloads to the services within the cluster

**Kubeconfig** - a metadata file that grants a user access to a Kubernetes cluster

**Master node** - a node from the Kubernetes control plane, that has installed components to make global, cluster-level decisions

**Microservice** - application design where application tiers are managed as independent, smaller units

**Monolith** - application design where all application tiers are managed as a single unit

**Namespace** - a logical separation between multiple applications and associated resources.

**Node** - a physical or virtual server

**Pod** - smallest manageable uint within a cluster that provides the execution environment for an application

**ReplicaSet** - a mechanism to ensure a number of pod replicas are up and running at all times

**Secret** - a resource to store confidential data in key-value pairs. These are base64 encoded.

**Service** - an abstraction layer over a collection of pods running an application

**Worker node** - a node from the Kubernetes data plane, that has installed components to host workloads
